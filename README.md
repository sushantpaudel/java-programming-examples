# Java Basic Functions Repository

Welcome to the Java Basic Functions repository! This repository is designed to help you learn and practice basic Java programming concepts. In this repository, you will find a collection of folders, each containing a Java program implementing a specific function or concept.

## How to Compile and Run the Programs

To compile the Java programs in each folder, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the Java program you want to compile using the `cd` command.
3. Use the `javac` command to compile the program. For example, to compile `Main.java`, run the following command:

```
javac Main.java
```

To run the compiled program, follow these steps:

1. In the same terminal or command prompt, ensure you are still in the same folder as the compiled program.
2. Use the `java` command followed by the name of the main class (typically `Main`) to run the program. For example, to run `Main.class`, run the following command:

```
java Main
```


Make sure you have Java installed on your machine and the `javac` and `java` commands are available in your system's PATH.

## Folder Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific Java program or concept. Inside each folder, you will find the Java source file(s) and any necessary resources.

Feel free to explore the different folders and study the code. You can modify the code, experiment with different inputs, and observe the program's behavior.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions, bug fixes, or additional Java functions that you would like to contribute, please feel free to submit a pull request. We appreciate your contributions and value your feedback.

Happy coding! âœ¨
